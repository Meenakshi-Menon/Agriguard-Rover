# 🌾 Agriguard Rover – AI-Powered Agricultural Rover

**April 2025**  
**Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, CNN, DenseNet121, ResNet50, Xception

Agriguard Rover is an AI-powered mobile agricultural rover designed to detect paddy leaf diseases in real-time with high precision. This project leverages deep learning techniques to support farmers with early disease identification, thus improving crop health and yield.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Detects common **paddy leaf diseases** with up to **95% accuracy**
- 🔍 Uses **image preprocessing with OpenCV** for optimal model input
- 🧠 Experimented with multiple deep learning models:
  - Custom CNN
  - ResNet50
  - Xception
  - ✅ Final Model: **DenseNet121**
- 📸 Real-time deployment-ready using TensorFlow
- 🛠️ Can be integrated with rover hardware for autonomous field inspection

---

## 🧑‍🌾 Use Case

Designed for agricultural fields where farmers can use the rover to automatically:
- Capture paddy leaf images
- Detect diseases on-the-spot
- Provide actionable insights for early intervention

## 📊 Model Evaluation

| Model       | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| CNN         | 88%      |
| ResNet50    | 92%      |
| Xception    | 93%      |
| **DenseNet121** | **95%**  |

> DenseNet121 outperformed other models in both training and validation phases and was selected as the final model.
